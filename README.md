# Extreme Sciencing practices
## What this is about

This page describes set of principles we try to follow in our day to day science job. These ideas are stolen from many areas, mainly from software development practices.

We try to follow these methods ourselves and implement them in our teams

## Key elements
 * Agile: main goal is successful research, not following some sort of "best practices" list
 * Rapid: We aim to move swiftly through the project, figuring bottlenecks as soon as possible
 * Responsible: We acknowledge that mistakes will be made and proactively look for ways to lower risks


## Notes on engineering

Central idea fro engineers is that they deploy products, something that will be used by other people. This could include microscopes, behavioral setups, software, data management solutions, and other elements of research environment.

This means that these projects should be treated in such a way that:
* Development should be based on written specification, result of conversion between users and engineers
* Final product includes evolving documentation
* Final product includes documented way to track issues and users' requests for new features
