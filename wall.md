# Wall of deadlines: proposal

## Preambule

In all lines of work, especially so in academia, inevitably so in PhD research projects, we often commit to unrealistic deadlines, projects, and goals. This is almost never tracked: we rarely see team saying something like:

`We have missed 40% of deadlines last year, and only 30% this year. Great job!`

We believe that such sentence displays few important principles of Extreme Sciencing paradigm:

1. **Concrete numbers**: if you are not tracking some parameter, you don't know whether you re improving or stay the same. We want to improve! And there is no way "we are doing better" will help without concrete number attached.

2. **Rightful bragging**: we need to recognize and celebrate achievements in all our work. By measuring deadline hits, we can celebrate lower rate of misses

3. **Recognize pockets of excellence / trouble on the horizon**: by celebrating we will automatically find people and teams from which we can learn. At the same time we will be able to see early if any project have higher than average rate of deadline misses.

## Goal

Organize subteam-, team-, and organization-wide space to share goals and track accomplishments.

## Out of scope

This project should not be used to punish people. They will quickly learn and stop participating.

This project should not be used to track achievement for the purposes of raises or career advancement. People will quickly learn and trick the system.

The value of this project comes from public commitments and personal goals made public. It cannot be used to compare different people, rather track personal progress with goal setting. We believe that setting unrealistic goals is detrimental and should be fought.

## Example design

Proposed design is very simple: we split given time into realistic periods, say 3-6 months. Whiteboard with dry-erase markers is dedicated in public space an labeled DNE (DoNotErase). Each team or person is given a personal column. At the top of the column we have total activity for given cycle, as few row of empty boxes, one per tasks:

`[] [] [] [] []...`

 Below that each line looks like that:

`[deadline date] [short comment]`

For example:

`18/03/30 Submit Amazon grant proposal`

When task is added, new empty box is put on top of the pile. When deadline hits, owner of the list can either check the box or cross it. It doesn't matter whether deadline is missed because we decided not to do the task, or were late, or task became irrelevant by other reason (*e.g.* Amazon burned down)

The boxes are checked with either green `V` mark for success or red `X` mark for miss. Tasks can be crossed-out after completion or missed deadline, but should stay on the board as long there is space.

At the end of each round (3-6 months) tally is made (as % hits and total tasks) and recorded. Board is erased except for all still open tasks and "boxes", and the process starts again. The tally can be kept for the whole year, at the end of year total count is saved.

## Expected results

At the end of cycle, we expect that Andrey will have column looking something like that:

`2018: [X] [V] [V] [V] [X] [V] [ ] [ ] [ ] 66%`

`18/04/01 Push new version of Extreme Sciencing`

`18/04/15 Submit paper WQS`

`18/05/1 First draft of XYZ paper to PI`
